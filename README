A thin Ruby interface layer to the Gemplus Block Protocol (GBP) library
(http://www.gemalto.com/techno/gbp_libraries/).

The GBP library provides a serial connection to the Gemalto (previously
Gemplus) Prox-PU and Prox-P2 readers.

Installation:

1. Fetch and unpack the GBP library kit itself (link above).

2. Apply the patch 'gbplib.patch' to the GBP library source, compile
   and install the library.

3. Build and install the Ruby interface:

     $ ruby extconf.rb --with-gbp-dir=/usr/local
     $ make
     $ make install

API:

    p = Chipcard::GBP::Reader("/dev/ttyS0")

    res = p.send( [ 0x22, 0x05, 0x3F, 0xF0, 0x10 ] )
    puts res

The commands that can be sent are described in the GILK Programmer's Guide
(link above).
